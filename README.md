## Note
1. I have only tested it on Ubuntu 22 and wrote it for that system. Although I have the time and willingness to write it for other systems, I don't think I will need to do so unless I am forced to.
2. I used ChatGPT to translate my words. Please pardon any mistakes in the translation.

## ToDo
- [ ] Add menu
- [ ] test it on other OS and modify the script for them
